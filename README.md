# ChaxAI

**ChaxAI** is an open-source, self-hosted AI assistant that allows users to chat with their own documents. It enables contextual Q&A over PDFs, markdown files, or structured knowledge bases by combining vector search with powerful LLMs like GPT-4.

> 🧠 Chat with your knowledge base — locally, securely, and intelligently.

## ✨ Features

- 🧾 **Document Understanding**  
  Parse and embed PDFs, Markdown, and plain text files.

- 🧠 **GPT-4 / OpenAI Integration**  
  Natural language responses backed by large language models.

- ⚡ **Fast Vector Search**  
  FAISS-powered embedding search for instant relevant context.

- 🔒 **Fully Self-Hosted**  
  No third-party storage — your data stays within your environment.

- 🧩 **Modular Architecture**  
  Easily swap in local models, different vector databases, or file types.

- 🛠 **Workflow Automation (WIP)**  
  Define rule-based triggers and automated responses for repetitive tasks.
